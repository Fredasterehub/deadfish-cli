# P2_G — Adversarial Review (Forced Find-Issues)

Review both drafts and produce 5-15 findings. "Looks good" is not allowed.

For each finding:
- Severity: HIGH / MED / LOW
- What is missing/unclear
- Why it matters
- Concrete fix suggestion

Categories to check:
- completeness
- consistency between VISION and ROADMAP
- testability of success metrics
- scope creep risk
- missing constraints
- dependency gaps

Prompt:
"Here are 5-15 issues to address (severity + fix). Which should we apply?"

Apply approved fixes and write final files.
