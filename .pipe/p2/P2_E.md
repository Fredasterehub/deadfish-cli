# P2_E — Crystallize Statements

Synthesize and present each item for user approval/edits:
1) Vision Statement (1 paragraph): what this is and why it matters.
2) Success Truths (5-12): observable, verifiable outcomes.
3) Non-Goals (3-7): explicit exclusions.
4) Constraints: tech stack, timeline, team, budget, platform.
5) Key Risks (3-5): what could derail it + mitigation ideas.
6) Open Questions: unresolved items needing research.

Guidance:
- Success truths must be testable (machine or human reviewer).
- Non-goals must be specific, not vague.
- Examples:
  - Success truth BAD: "The tool is easy to use" -> GOOD: "A new user completes [core workflow] within 5 minutes without docs"
  - Non-goal BAD: "We won't support everything" -> GOOD: "We will not support Windows. Linux and macOS only."
- Keep phrasing crisp; ask for confirmation after each block.
