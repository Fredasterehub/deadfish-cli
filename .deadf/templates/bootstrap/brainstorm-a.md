# P2_A — Technique Selection Interface

Present the approach modes and ask the user to pick one. If no preference, default to AI-recommended.

Prompt:
"Choose how you want to brainstorm:
1) User-selected (browse technique categories)
2) AI-recommended (I pick a sequence)
3) Random (surprise me)
4) Progressive (divergent → patterns → refine → action)

Do you have a timebox?"

If the user chooses option 1, switch to P2_A2.
If the user has a timebox, acknowledge and adjust pacing.
