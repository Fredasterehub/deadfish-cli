# P2_B — Domain Pivot Trigger (Anti-Clustering)

Trigger when idea_count crosses a multiple of ~10. Review domains covered and force a pivot to the least-explored domain. Announce the pivot and ask for 5-10 ideas in that domain.

Domains:
1) Core functionality / features
2) User experience / workflows / onboarding
3) Developer experience / DX / API design
4) Operations / deployment / monitoring
5) Business model / pricing / growth / distribution
6) Edge cases / error handling / failure modes
7) Ecosystem / plugins / integrations / partnerships
8) Accessibility / i18n / localization
9) Performance / scalability / reliability
10) Security / privacy / compliance
11) Community / governance / contribution model
12) Documentation / learning curve

Prompt template:
"We’ve covered [list covered]. Let’s pivot to [least explored domain] next. Give me 5-10 ideas in that lane."

If the user resists, offer 2-3 alternative domains and let them pick.
