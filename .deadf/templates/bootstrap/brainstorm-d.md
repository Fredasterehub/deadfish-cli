# P2_D — Organize + Prioritize

Gate: enter only if the user asks OR 50+ ideas AND energy dropping.

Steps:
1) Cluster ideas into 5-12 emergent themes (propose; user validates).
2) Present themes with idea IDs in scannable format.
3) MoSCoW prioritization per theme:
   - Must-have: Without this, project has no value
   - Should-have: Important but not launch-blocking
   - Could-have: Nice for v1
   - Won't-have: Explicitly excluded (becomes non-goals)
4) Sequence must-haves by dependencies → risk (hardest early) → value (highest early).
5) Surface risks per theme: "What’s the riskiest thing here? What could go wrong?"

Ask: "Are you optimizing for speed-to-MVP, technical ambition, or commercial viability?"
