# deadfish-cli

> Autonomous dev pipeline that runs plan → implement → verify → commit loops using CLI tools (Bash + Python + Claude Code + Codex). No framework, no bots — just filesystem artifacts and deterministic verification.

deadfish-cli enforces strict role separation across five actors: Ralph (bash loop controller), Claude Code Orchestrator (reads state, dispatches work), GPT-5.2 Planner (decomposes tasks via Codex MCP), GPT-5.2-Codex Implementer (writes code via codex exec), and Verifier (verify.sh + LLM review). State lives in YAML files under `.deadf/state/` (STATE.yaml for position, POLICY.yaml for rules). All cycle artifacts persist to `.deadf/logs/`. The pipeline supports three execution modes: yolo (full autonomy), hybrid (human checkpoints at track boundaries), and interactive (human approves every task).
